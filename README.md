# Multi-Paradigm Minesweeper

## Description
In this repository I will be creating Minesweeper in 3 different paradigms
and languages. This will involve carried out using Rust, C++ and Prolog. 

## Why these languages?
I have chosen these languages as they all represent different programming paradigms
and I will demonstrate the core differences there are between these paradigms.

## Languages and paradigms
Rust - Imperative and Functional Paradigms
C++ - Imperative, procedural and Object-Orientated Paradigms
Prolog - Logic Paradigm

## Prequisites
- gcc 
- rustc 
- gnu prolog
